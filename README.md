# powerproject

This project is aimed, to let me disable certian devices to wake my computer. I had the problem, that my ethernet controller woke up my PC without me beeing present, wich led to the PC running for hours. And due to the fact, that windows updates sometimes reset those settings I wanted to have a simple programm to run everytime I need to restore my settings.

**Need to be run as admin**

Known issues: Only disables the first item in list.


## VBScrip

The VBS file no longer has to be run as admin. While starting the programm the UAC PopUp asks for elevated rights. If denied Programm closes.
